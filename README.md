## Deployment to AWS

As stated before, this is a simple example how to deploy this solution to AWS using the Serverless Application Model, also known as SAM. In this walkthrough, the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) will be used instead of a local terminal.

> Before you begin, please ensure you have a valid AWS account.

The first step is to update the `template.yaml` file with your environment-specific secrets. The following values need to be updated in the `template.yaml` file:

```
        {
          "CLIENT_ID": "2MO_w2n1AqT7ItBzfdas342fdasf897fdas",
          "USERNAME": "john.doe@example.com",
          "LOGIN_URL": "login.salesforce.com",
          "RSA_PRIVATE_KEY": "V3Q2RQZm93eGFvZW13Vys5OGFnQ1dCQTErZGlNMTkrc...",
        }
```

### Where to get the variables

CLIENT_ID can be gathered from the Connect App within the Salesforce instance and it is labeled `Consumer Key` once the Connected App is created.
USERNAME is the email address of the user logging into Salesforce
LOGIN_URL is exactly as the variable states `login.salesforce.com` and you can leave that one as is.
RSA_PRIVATE_KEY is the private key generated by your certificate and it comes in the following format:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIBOgIBAAJBAKj34GkxFhD90vcNLYLInFEX6Ppy1tPf9Cnzj4p4WGeKLs1Pt8Qu
KUpRKfFLfRYC9AIKjbJTWit+CqvjWYzvQwECAwEAAQJAIJLixBy2qpFoS4DSmoEm

TQIhAKMSvzIBnni7ot/OSie2TmJLY4SwTQAevXysE2RbFDYdAiEBCUEaRQnMnbp7
9mxDXDf6AU0cN/RPBjb9qSHDcWZHGzUCIG2Es59z8ugGrDY+pxLQnwfotadxd+Uy
v/Ow5T0q5gIJAiEAyS4RaI9YG8EWx/2w0T67ZUVAw8eOMB6BIUg0Xcu+3okCIBOs
/5OiPgoTdSy7bcF9IGpSE8ZgGKzgYQVZeN97YE00
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Make a copy of your key (yes, all of it) and encode it to a base64 format. This can be done by simply going to any base64 encode website (here's an example: https://www.base64encode.org/) and then take the note of the encoded string:

```
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
```

This encoded string is going to be your `RSA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable.

**Note:** We have encoded the key because otherwise, the Secrets Manager would break the formatting casing issues with the authentication.

### YAML template updates

Once you have all the variables in your `deploy.yaml` file, save the file and proceed to the next step.

The next step is to zip the contents of the `aws/` folder. This means you will zip the following files and folders:

```
deploy.yaml
node_modules/
src/
 |-- utils
        |-- getToken.mjs
index.mjs
package.json
package-lock.json
```

> Does this structure matter? Yes, it does matter as a specific folder structure has to be followed when uploading a Lambda function.

### AWS SAM deployment

Log into the AWS Console and open the AWS CloudShell by clicking on the CloudShell icon in the bottom left of the AWS Console.

Once the CloudShell terminal opens, on the right-hand side, you will see a button labeled **Actions**. Click on it and select **Upload file** and select your the newly created `zip` file.

Run the following commands in the CloudShell:

```
unzip <name-of-your-zip-file>
sam build
```

Once the build step finishes, run the following command:

```
sam deploy --guided
```

This step will guide you through the deployment and ask the following questions:

```
 Stack Name [sam-app]: the name of the CloudFormation stack that will be deployed

 AWS Region [us-east-2]: default AWS region where this stack will be deployed

 Shows you resources changes to be deployed and require a 'Y' to initiate deploy: do you want an extra validation step before deploying the resources

 SAM needs permission to be able to create roles to connect to the resources in your template: allow SAM to create roles to connect the necessary resources

 preserves the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails: do you want to keep the deployed resources in case something fails

 Save arguments to configuration file [Y/n]: Do you want to save the arguments for future use?

```

Once the deployment is successful, you will see the endpoint URL in the terminal output section and you can send your requests there!

That is it! You have successfully deployed this project into an AWS account using SAM. Once this is done, you will fined the appropriate resources created within your AWS account. Now you can navigate to your newly created S3 bucket and upload a file to be picked up by Data Cloud's vectorization process.
